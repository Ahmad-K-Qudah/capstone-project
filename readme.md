#  Task Manager App

**Task Manager** is a simple and responsive to-do list web application built with **Django**.  
It allows users to **create, update, and delete tasks**, and mark them as completed.  
Each user has their own account and can log in to manage their personal list of tasks.  

The main goal of this project was to practice **full-stack development** using Django â€” combining backend logic with front-end styling and user authentication.

As a user, I want to add new tasks so that I can keep track of what I need to do.

As a user, I want to view all my tasks so that I can see whatâ€™s pending or completed.

As a user, I want to edit my tasks so that I can update details such as the name, description, or due date.

As a user, I want to delete tasks so that I can remove tasks that are no longer needed
